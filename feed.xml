                <p><a href="https://www.valheimgame.com/">Valheim's</a> Early Access release on Steam has taken the gaming world by storm. But as with any early access game, Valheim is no stranger to bugs, and it's important to frequently back up your worlds in case you ever need to restore them.</p>
<p>In my case, I'm hosting a dedicated server on Ubuntu. I installed and manage Valheim through <a href="https://linuxgsm.com/lgsm/vhserver/">LinuxGSM</a>, which is a great command line tool for managing dedicated servers for over 100 games. I wanted to automate world backups every thirty minutes to my personal Google Drive, and here's how I did it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<h2>Step 1: Set up Rclone</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We'll be using <a href="https://rclone.org/">Rclone</a> to easily integrate with the cloud service of your choice. This is a great, free, open-source command line program that lets you manage files on over 40 different cloud storage providers.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Follow the instructions to <a href="https://rclone.org/downloads/">download</a> and <a href="https://rclone.org/install/">install</a> using your favorite method, and then follow the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/">documentation</a> to configure with your cloud provider of choice by running <code>rclone config</code>. I used Google Drive, which took just a couple minutes to set up. Keep whatever name you assign to your configuration handy.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Step 2: Find your Valheim worlds</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Locate your Valheim worlds folder, which may vary depending on your installation. In my case through LinuxGSM, this was in <code>/home/vhserver/.config/unity3d/IronGate/Valheim/worlds/</code>. A world is made up of two files, a <code>.db</code> and <code>.fwl </code>(<code></code> being whatever you named your world at creation). These are the files we'll want to back up.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Step 3: Schedule backup via crontab</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To schedule the backup, we'll edit our crontab through <code>crontab -e</code>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At the end of the file, switch cron's default shell from sh to bash by adding:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><code>SHELL=/bin/bash</code></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is needed to support the curly-brace syntax I use to select multiple files at once.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The next step is adding the commands to zip the world files and upload to the cloud. Here is mine (note that the name of my world is Serendipity and the name of my Rclone config is gdrive; change yours respectively).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong><code>0,30 * * * * /usr/bin/zip -j /home/vhserver/.config/unity3d/IronGate/Valheim/worlds/Serendipity-Backup.zip /home/vhserver/.config/unity3d/IronGate/Valheim/worlds/Serendipity.{db,fwl} &amp;&amp; rclone copyto /home/vhserver/.config/unity3d/IronGate/Valheim/worlds/Serendipity-Backup.zip gdrive:Serendipity-$(date +\%Y-\%m-\%d-\%H:\%M).zip</code> </strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here's an explanation for each part:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><code>0,30 * * * *</code><br>This is standard crontab syntax for scheduling. It can be read as "minute - hour - day (of the month) - month - day (of the week)". In my case, I scheduled my backup to occur every half-hour at :00 and :30. You can adjust yours accordingly. If you wanted to do once a day at 3 AM, you would use <code>0 3 * * *</code>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><code><code>/usr/bin/zip -j /home/vhserver/.config/unity3d/IronGate/Valheim/worlds/Serendipity-Backup.zip /home/vhserver/.config/unity3d/IronGate/Valheim/worlds/Serendipity.{db,fwl}</code></code><br>Here I'm zipping up my world files (Serendipity.db and Serendipity.fwl). You'll want to compress these files as they are otherwise quite large. Uncompressed, my world files are 30 MB and growing, while compressing them brings them down to 10 MB. The -j flag disregards the directory names, so that your zip file will have the world files at the root level, instead of nested within /home/vhserver/....</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><code>rclone copyto /home/vhserver/.config/unity3d/IronGate/Valheim/worlds/Serendipity-Backup.zip gdrive:Serendipity-$(date +\%Y-\%m-\%d-\%H:\%M).zip</code><br>Here I'm performing the actual clone through copyto. I'm taking our new zip file and uploading it to our previously-configured remote (mine is called gdrive). I set the name of each file to the name of my world followed by a timestamp; you can change this however you wish.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And that's about it! Once you've got the backup working, do a practice run of restoring your world from the backup to ensure it actually works (and manually save your existing world files on the server in case the backup doesn't actually work!). If you run into any questions or have any issues, feel free to comment below.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>I was invited by a friend to join the incredible <a href="https://www.woodside.co/">Woodside</a> community in attending Sundance 2020. While I've always appreciated a good film, I've never been big into movies, and going to a film festival is not something I would ever plan of my own accord. But with a community to attend with, logistics taken care of, and a Utah to explore for the first time, I hopped on the opportunity and headed to Park City for a few days for a taste of the experience.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<figcaption>A Q&amp;A session after one of the movies.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once I was cozied up with new friends in an adorable Park City house, I hit up the communal ticket collection to decide on what I'd be watching that weekend (like most things in my life, it's all last-minute decisions). I always love a good documentary, which made up three of my five selections, but I threw in a couple dramas as well. All were excellent choices.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<h2>Films I Watched</h2>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://www.sundance.org/projects/a-thousand-cuts">A Thousand Cuts</a></em></strong> - This incredible documentary covers Duterte's rise to power in the Philippines, the drug war, extrajudicial killings, and his powerful disinformation campaign - centered around the experiences of Rappler's CEO, Maria Ressa, and her staff.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://www.sundance.org/projects/crip-camp">Crip Camp</a></em></strong> - The film starts at Camp Jened, a summer camp for disabled teens to be themselves in a welcoming setting. We then follow several of the teens over the following decades as they work tireless to advocate for the rights of the disabled, including the enforcement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_504_of_the_Rehabilitation_Act">Section 504</a> and the passage of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990">ADA.</a></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.sundance.org/projects/disclosure-trans-lives-on-screen"><strong>Disclosure: Trans Lives on Screen</strong></a></em> - A fantastic documentary that takes an in-depth look at Hollywood's depiction of transgender people, and how society's perception of trans characters has evolved over the decades. As I mentioned, I've never been a big film buff, and I learned a lot from the insights of everyone who contributed their stories to this production.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.sundance.org/projects/i-carry-you-with-me"><strong>I Carry You With Me</strong></a></em> - An absolutely delightful Spanish drama following the romance between two men, one of whom is out as a gay man. Societal pressure causes conflict and the relationship is put to the test over many years. A rich, beautiful story that I'd recommend everyone watch.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.sundance.org/projects/ironbark"><strong>Ironbark</strong></a></em> (edit: now <em>The Courier</em>) - A historical drama following a British businessman, Greville Wynne, who assists the MI6 with infiltrating the Soviet Union. Wynne befriends his Soviet informant, leading to intense drama and suspense as things start heading south. The plot reminded me of <em>Bridge of Spies</em>, and I'm a sucker for these kinds of movies. I highly enjoyed this one.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Seeing Utah</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Having never been to Utah, I also took a full day to rent a car and explore the area surrounding Park City, and I fell in love with the incredible mountainous landscape, freshly covered in snow. One of my priorities in any trip is to find great views of landscapes to photograph, and the area surrounding Salt Lake City does not disappoint. This alone propelled Salt Lake City to the top of my list of potential-places-to-live, I'm looking forward to returning again to give it the proper exploration it deserves.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>Spring 2016 marked the one-year anniversary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Connection">Wikipedia Connection</a>, a student organization I founded alongside several friends at The Ohio State University. The group's aim is to educate students and faculty about Wikipedia, host events, and otherwise be a resource for anyone looking to edit or learn more about Wikipedia. If you'd like to know more about its inception, check out my post: <a href="http://blog.kevinpayravi.com/2015/09/13/the-start-of-wikipedia-connection/">The Start of Wikipedia Connection</a></p>
<p>As a way to tie-up the year and showcase our achievements, I created an <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2b3Tc53Pa6xZ04wV2R1WXp1Ulk/view">Annual Report</a></strong> for Wikipedia Connections' 2015-16 academic year. It's been a fantastic year of both growth and learning for our students. Our Autumn 2015 workshops drew in an average of ~5 attendees, while our Spring 2016 workshops drew in ~9. What was once just a few students in a study room has turned into events that draw 10+ people; nothing staggering, but promising!</p>
<p><strong>Some Stats for the 2015-16 Year:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>30+ unique attendees, which includes students and faculty.</li>
<li>14 new articles.</li>
<li>18 weekly workshops.</li>
<li>4 major events.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I've said before and I'll say it again: I have much thanks to give to everyone who has helped Wikipedia Connection along so far. The utmost of thanks goes towards my close friends who helped get Wikipedia Connection off the ground; without them, we wouldn’t be around. Another thanks goes to all current officers, advisors, faculty assistants, and the greater Wikimedia community who help make everything we do possible - all of which are mentioned in the annual report.</p>
<p>Going into the next year is pretty exciting. Some of the things our group hopes to tackle:</p>
<ul>
<li>More collaboration with other student organizations. This is already happening as we have become an official backer of <a href="http://hack.osu.edu/2016/">HackOHI/O 2016</a>, Ohio State's largest hackathon.</li>
<li>Bring Wikipedia to the classroom as part of the <a href="https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Education">Wikipedia Education Program</a>.</li>
<li>Better engage the off-campus Columbus community.</li>
<li>Initiate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM">GLAM projects</a> with various Ohio State and Columbus institutions, to bring materials and knowledge to the web.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's to another great year!</p>

                <p>This last weekend (June 24 - 26) was <a href="http://hackcon.io/na/">Hackcon IV</a>, a 350-person conference for hackathon organizers put on by <a href="https://mlh.io/">Major Hacking League (MLH)</a>. The majority of participants represented college hackathons, and I went to the conference alongside five of my fellow Ohio State students on behalf of <a href="http://hack.osu.edu/">OHI/O</a>, the student organization I help organize for back on campus. It was an exciting event as this was my first real exposure to hackathon organizers from around the country.<a href="http://blog.kevinpayravi.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/haclcpm.png"> </a></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/7/hackcon-4-logo.png" alt="Hackcon 4 Logo" width="262" height="52" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/hackcon-4-logo-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/hackcon-4-logo-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/hackcon-4-logo-md.png 768w"></figure>
<p>This season's Hackcon took place at the YMCA of the Rockies in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estes_Park,_Colorado">Estes Park, Colorado</a>. The YMCA was nested right in the middle of Rocky Mountain National Park; this was my first time in Colorado and my first time up-close to the Rocky Mountains, so needless to say, the views were breathtaking for me.</p>
<figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/7/ymca-of-the-rockies.jpg" alt="YMCA of the Rockies" width="630" height="472" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/ymca-of-the-rockies-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/ymca-of-the-rockies-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/7/responsive/ymca-of-the-rockies-md.jpg 768w"></figure>

</figure>
<p>The conference lasted for three days and was filled with keynotes, presentations, and open discussions. While MLH organizers were heavily involved, these activities also included company representatives, professors, and of course, fellow hackathon organizers. Representatives were present from all the event sponsors: GitHub, Microsoft, a16z, KPCB, Brand Makers, Devpost, and Potbelly Sandwiches. This allowed for great networking opportunities, along with getting a chance to learn from professionals' experiences and their thoughts on the hackathon scene. And of course, with companies comes "swag" - and for all the hackers there, the goodies were pretty much out of this world. We're talking yellow GitHub education backpacks, countless stickers, shirts, and more.</p>

<p>We had a lot of fun on the side, too. Mornings and evenings included hikes, and we were free to use the YMCA facilities throughout the day. The night was filled with campfire talks, s'mores, board games, and rap battles (<em>good </em>rap battles, too, which was surprising). The whole conference provided a perfect mix of formal events and informal socialization.</p>

<p>The most valuable thing for me was meeting other organizers. Everyone there was a self-selecting individual that was passionate about their respective hackathon program. Not only did the OHI/O team get the chance to learn a <em>lot</em> from the experiences and ideas of other organizers, but we had a great time simply hanging out and being ourselves. I also know OHI/O brought a lot to the table. We all met countless new people who we hope we manage to stay in touch with.</p>
<p>Through our discussions, I feel like I also managed to take home several key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your team is as important as anything else. You should put as much time and effort into building your team, learning about each other, and making sure everyone feels respected and valued as you would organizing the hackathon itself. One of the things I hope our team does a better job of this semester is learning about each other, spending more time together outside of organizing, and making sure we interact in a way that makes everyone feel valued.</li>
<li>Most of everything you want to do has been done before. Don't be afraid to reach out and see how others have done it in the past.</li>
<li>Make the event personal. Organizers should go around the room and ask hackers about their projects; not only does it show that people are interested in their project, but it makes the event more personable and provides an opportunity for hackers to practice presenting their project. This not only motivates hackers, but helps boost their confidence to stay at the hackathon all the way through 'til judgement time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I ended the conference on a high note. I learned a lot as a hackathon organizer, and also on a personal level. I also hope I brought a lot to the table for other organizers. Hackcon is definitely something I'd like to attend in the future - and I'll have to go back to Colorado to keep exploring those Rockies, too.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>We're already a week into 2016, but I figured it wouldn't be too late to write up a summary of my 2015. I don't usually make specific resolutions each year. Instead, I tend to set the broad goal of having a better year than the last. This means learning more, being more productive, improving my social life, and all-around staying healthy. That all being said, I figured I'd highlight what I was most proud of in 2015!</p>
<h2><a href="http://hack.osu.edu/2015/"><strong>OHI/O 2015 Hackathon</strong></a></h2>
<p>I attended OHI/O 2014 with a couple friends of mine where we threw together the <a href="https://github.com/BootyPlatooners/CollegeMoodMeter">CollegeMoodMeter</a>. It was my first collegiate hackathon, and it was relatively small; 200 people hacked on two floors of the <a href="https://library.osu.edu/about/locations/18th-avenue-library/">18th Avenue Library</a> in an event put on by just a handful of people. After the event, I was intrigued by the hackathon scene and offered to help organize OHI/O 2015.</p>
<p>Come 2015, and the group of organizers grew from less than ten to over twenty. We split into separate committees, and I became co-chair of branding and web development. Initial planning started during Spring 2015, but it was not til August that we really buckled down as a group and got moving. The goal was to go big. We wanted to go from 200 to 350 students. We were going to host the event in the Grand Ballroom of the Ohio Union. We ordered custom OHI/O apparel, and grew our sponsor support from just a handful to over twenty. This planning phase was both an exciting and stressful time, as a lot of us had very little prior experience with hackathon organizing. My favorite part about this was the chance to work with and befriend an enthusiastic group of people who share a lot of interests with me.</p>
<p>The result? An awesome hackathon that went over capacity (in a good way!) with over 500 attendees.</p>
<p>While hosting, I realized hackers are surprisingly low-maintenance; everyone chugs away at their computers, and minimal distractions are what most people desire.</p>
<p>It was awesome to provide the setting and resources for hackers to build amazing things (our slogan was 'building something amazing' after all), and even better was the resulting fallout. For weeks after the hackathon, we received feedback from professors describing good things they've heard about the hackathon from their students. One even noticed a tendency for students in her labs to collaborate a lot more than usual (and for quiet computer science majors like me, that's saying something). A number of projects have been seeing continued development and launches, which is also great. And this is all a big motivation for 2016's event.</p>
<p>OHI/O 2015 was a great event but also an imperfect one. Now that our group's had the experience running a hackathon at this scale, and knowing our strengths and weaknesses, I'm looking forward at 2016 being one step closer to perfect.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Connection">Wikipedia Connection</a></strong></h2>
<p>In an <a href="http://blog.kevinpayravi.com/2015/09/13/the-start-of-wikipedia-connection/">earlier blog post</a>, I detailed the creation of a new student organization at Ohio State: <a href="http://blog.kevinpayravi.com/2015/10/11/the-buckeye-edit-a-thon/">Wikipedia Connection</a>. Founded in Spring 2015 through the help of some great friends, the goal of our organization is to educate students and faculty about Wikipedia, host events, and be a resource for anyone looking to edit Wikipedia or integrate it into the classroom setting. In another <a href="http://blog.kevinpayravi.com/2015/10/11/the-buckeye-edit-a-thon/">blog post</a>, I detailed on our first big event in September, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Connection/Buckeye_Edit-A-Thon_2015">Buckeye Edit-A-Thon</a>. It was an awesome event that brought together students from a variety of backgrounds to learn more about Wikipedia and editing. Since then, the club hasn't had any more major events, but has been hosting weekly workshops where students come together, discuss Wikipedia, get editing help, and socialize. It's been great, but I'm hoping to really move things forward in 2016. In December, we submitted <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:PEG/Wikipedia_Connection/Semester_Funding_for_Workshops_and_Events">a grant request</a> to the Wikimedia Foundation to get funding for a variety of events in Spring 2016. These include a <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_15/Events/Columbus,_Ohio">Wikipedia birthday celebration event</a>, two edit-a-thons (including an <a href="http://art.plusfeminism.org/">Arts+Feminism event</a>), a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Takes_Your_City">photography event</a>, collaborations with various departments, and more. 2015 was all about setting up the foundation of the club, and I'm exciting to see things move forward this year. None of this would be possible without the support of my friends, club members, the Wikimedia Foundation, the <a href="https://wikiedu.org/">Wiki Education Foundation</a>, and many others within the Wikimedia community.</p>
<p>Stemming off that, I'm also happy to have been regularly contributing to Wikipedia. In addition to my typical editing, I helped out as an organizer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Asian_Month">Wikimedia Asia Month</a>, which was a lot of fun and saw the expansion of a <em>lot</em> of Asian-related subjects. In total I made 3,405 edits to Wikipedia in 2015. Relatively that's not a lot...2015 was my 4th most active year, and 3,405 is only a little more than half of the number of edits I made in 2014. Naturally edit count <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Editcountitis">is not everything</a>, and I've been putting time into Wikipedia through means such as Wikipedia Connection - but one of my goals for 2016 will be to contribute directly to Wikipedia and its sister projects more often.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="https://wikiconferenceusa.org/wiki/2015/Main_Page">WikiConference USA</a></strong></h2>
<p>More Wikipedia stuff! I was fortunate enough to have received a scholarship to attend <a href="https://wikiconferenceusa.org/wiki/2015/Main_Page">WikiConference USA</a>, the national conference for Wikimedians in the United States. This one took place in Washington, D.C., right inside of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives_Building">National Archives Building</a>. It was my first time visiting D.C. on my own, and also my first time in that building, so it was an exciting experience. This was also my first time attending a major Wikimedia event, and it was mind-blowing in a way. Hundreds of people with a passion in the project came together to socialize, discuss the movement, and give fascinating presentations. I got to listen to a lot of amazing people discuss a variety of topics, from diversity problems to machine learning. I even did a quick impromptu lightning speech on Wikipedia Connection at the end. These types of conferences are something I'm definitely looking forward to attending in the future.</p>

<h2><strong><a href="https://www.onbase.com/">Interning at Hyland</a></strong></h2>
<p>Shifting gears from Ohio State things, I had the opportunity to intern with <a href="http://Overlooking OHI/O 2015 participants in the Grand Ballroom of the Ohio Union. Overlooking OHI/O 2015 participants in the Grand Ballroom of the Ohio Union.">Hyland, creator of OnBase</a>. I did provide some details of the internship <a href="http://blog.kevinpayravi.com/2015/08/28/my-hyland-internship/">in another blog post</a>, so I won't go into too much detail here. I learned a <em>lot </em>from the internship, including learning a new programming language, experiencing a professional work environment, and, as I was working in the Services department, I got to see first-hand the business side of a software-producing business. I was fortunate enough to even get to shadow a business trip to Oklahoma City. I'm still working for Hyland remotely from Ohio State, where I continue to expand on the project I did this summer, which is a great opportunity that keeps me connected and working.</p>
<h2><strong>Ohio State</strong></h2>
<p>I can't get by without mentioning Ohio State at-large. In addition to the above extracurriculars, it was a good year academically. I got into my major (Computer Science and Engineering), and classes went well. I got the chance to attend two amazing concerts, too. Through Ohio State, I was lucky enough to win two cheap tickets for Twenty One Pilots, my sister's favorite band. I also got to experience Passion Pit in the Newport Music Hall with some of my great friends. And I can't go without mentioning Buckeye Football - it's a big deal around here, apparently. Champions at the beginning of the year, and a pretty good 2015-16 season. The blackout was pretty great against Penn State.</p>

<h2><strong>Vacation</strong></h2>
<p>This was a good year of travel with my family (as led by my mom). During the summer, we drove to Boston and went sight-seeing there. We then got a change of scenery and drove on the Cape, visiting a nice small beach called Chapin Beach. For the second part of the trip, we hit up Maine. We first stopped in Portland, which was a fantastic little city - it was a nice mix of lumberjack, hipster, and modern. We then drove up to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boothbay_Harbor,_Maine">Boothbay Harbor</a>, which is a cute town and popular tourist destination. Tiny hobbyist shops, boating, and lots of seafood were the three things I'd use to describe it. Finally, for the last leg of the trip, we spent a day in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadia_National_Park">Acadia National Park</a>, a beautiful 47,000 acre park with something different around every corner. Maine was surprising to me: great city and amazing nature. It's a peaceful and quiet place to live, and I now know why it's a popular place to go boating during the summer.</p>
<p>Other than the summer vacationing, the one other place we went was Pittsburgh for an impulsive trip on Christmas Eve. We went to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phipps_Conservatory_and_Botanical_Gardens">Phipps Botanical Gardens</a> (decorated all nice for the holidays), drove through Carnegie Melon, ate at a kebab place right off campus, and then went shopping in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_District,_Pittsburgh">Strip District</a>. Pittsburgh isn't a place I'd want to live, but it's a great city that manages to make "gritty" appealing.</p>
<figure class="size-full wp-image-151"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/6/pittsburgh-overview.png" alt="A view of Pittsburgh from the top of the Dusquene Incline." width="597" height="431" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/6/responsive/pittsburgh-overview-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/6/responsive/pittsburgh-overview-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/6/responsive/pittsburgh-overview-md.png 768w"></figure>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Those are the highlights of my 2015. As I enter into my second semester as a Junior, I'm exited to build on everything described here and see what 2016's New Year's post will contain a year from now.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>In my <a href="http://blog.kevinpayravi.com/2015/09/13/the-start-of-wikipedia-connection/">last blog post</a> I wrote about the creation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Connection">Wikipedia Connection</a>, a new student organization I founded alongside several friends at The Ohio State University. The group's aim is to educate students and faculty about Wikipedia, host events, and be a resource for anyone looking to edit Wikipedia or integrate it into the classroom setting. We've already seen Wikipedia pushed through colleges through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Education_program">Wikipedia Education Program</a>, which supports classrooms that integrate Wikipedia contributions as part of the coursework. It's a fantastic program that has sparked good content and new editors - though it is set in a formal classroom setting, and often for a grade. There has been very little going on at college campuses to bring together Wikipedians in a more <em>casual</em>, volunteer and sociable manner.</p>
<p>On September 8, 2015, Wikipedia Connection hosted its first major event: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Connection/Buckeye_Edit-A-Thon_2015">Buckeye Edit-A-Thon</a>. The goal of this event was to bring together Ohio State students and staff who have any interest in Wikipedia. Before planning this event, I was fortunate enough to have the chance to talk to the blue-clad <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Bluerasberry">Lane Rasberry</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Samantha_(Wiki_Ed)">Samantha Erickson</a> from the <a href="http://wikiedu.org/">Wiki Education Foundation</a> to get their insights on hosting a student-oriented edit-a-thon.</p>
<p>We started the edit-a-thon with an introduction geared towards new editors. In addition to introducing statistics, policy, and the how-to's behind editing, the presentation focused on explaining <em>why</em> people edit Wikipedia. Once the presentation was completed we dove into editing for an hour or two, with the goal of improving Wikipedia's coverage of Ohio State University and Columbus - as those two subjects are something all Ohio Staters have in common. Prior to the event, I assembled a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Connection/Buckeye_Edit-A-Thon_2015/To-do">to-do list</a> of articles needing help with notes on what needs improving (references, grammar, wording, etc.).</p>
<figure class="aligncenter"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/5/640px-Wikipedia_Connection_-_Buckeye_Edit-A-Thon_2015.jpg" alt="A library meeting room with several participants sitting with their laptops, editing Wikipedia articles." width="560" height="420" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/5/responsive/640px-Wikipedia_Connection_-_Buckeye_Edit-A-Thon_2015-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/5/responsive/640px-Wikipedia_Connection_-_Buckeye_Edit-A-Thon_2015-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/5/responsive/640px-Wikipedia_Connection_-_Buckeye_Edit-A-Thon_2015-md.jpg 768w"></figure>
<figcaption >The event underway!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And I'm happy to say that the event went fairly well! We were prepared for a maximum of 35 participants, and ended up with 15 (a majority of undergraduate students, with a few graduate students and faculty). The strong majority of attendees had never edited, or had only edited a few times with little experience. With information from the presentation and help from others and me, editors took off editing in the 1 to 2 hours they were given. Here are some quick stats of the result of the edit-a-thon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attendees who have never edited: 6</li>
<li>Articles edited: 19</li>
<li>Articles created: 2</li>
<li>Number of edits to articles: 67</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the most valuable takeaways I had after the event:</p>
<ul>
<li>General readers know very little about how Wikipedia works in the backend. Many were shocked that editing took little more than the click of the "edit" and "submit" buttons - and the confidence to do so is lacking.</li>
<li>Nearly everyone (if not everyone) left the event on a positive note, and the desire to attend future events.</li>
<li>If you bring a group of people who have an interest in Wikipedia together, Wikipedia is where their common interests end. As I stated before, the goal of this edit-a-thon was to improve Wikipedia's coverage of Ohio State and Columbus-related articles. While we mainly did contribute to those subjects through the options provided on the <a href="http://Before planning this event, I was fortunate enough to have the chance to talk to the blue-clad Lane Rasberry and Samantha Erickson from the Wiki Education Foundation to get their insights on hosting a student-oriented edit-a-thon.">to-do list</a>, some editors made their first contributions to the "recommended articles" that are given to users when they register; several others edited articles on whatever subjects interested them (including anime, video game soundtracks, and French folios).</li>
<li><em>Post-engagement is important!</em> After the event, almost all new editors didn't edit again on their own time. I'm unsure of the exact reasons, but I imagine it's a mix: a lack of motivation as new editors, not sure of what to edit next, or simply the lack of free time. Because of this, Wikipedia Connection's next step is to keep students engaged through hosting regular workshops for students to edit, discuss ask questions, and get guidance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The future holds a lot of opportunities. In addition to the previously mentioned workshops, we're planning on hosting more edit-a-thons. In particular, we're looking at hosting an <a href="http://art.plusfeminism.org/">Art+Feminism</a> event in March. We're also exploring opportunities with various Ohio State departments, such as acquiring images and content to upload from the Ohio State Archives. As a new club, there's a lot of options for us to explore - stay tuned!</p>

<h3>Here's the story behind starting a new student organization about Wikipedia.</h3>
<p>
I've been editing Wikipedia since I was 13. It was a young age to start, and naturally I started editing where I was most comfortable: video game articles. Since then, I've learned a lot and expanded into all sorts of areas of Wikipedia. Writing articles, image licensing, new page patrol, you name it. What I've recently been enjoying most, however, is bringing new editors to Wikipedia and helping out the current ones. My idea is that any one editor can physically only do so much...but an editor who brings in five full-time editors has potentially created the ability to do five times more for Wikipedia than any one editor could ever do on their own.</p>
<p>When I came to Ohio State, I learned about Wikipedia's <a href="https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Education">Education Program</a>. Here's the premise: Instead of having students write research papers that land in a recycling bin, why not have students research content that is put to good use in Wikipedia articles? The goal of the Education Program is for Wikipedians to support educators that implement Wikipedia editing into their courses. This is done by providing advice, assistance, and materials.</p>
<p>As part of the program, Wikipedians can sign up to assist courses as "online ambassadors". At the time (Autumn 2014), I noticed two ongoing courses at Ohio State that were enrolled in Wikipedia's Education Program: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Program:Ohio_State_University/EEOB3310_Evolution_(Autumn_2014)">Evolution</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Program:Ohio_State_University/City_and_Regional_Planning_(Fall_2014)">City and Regional Planning</a>. I signed up as an ambassador for these courses, and helped answer any questions professors and their students had about editing. As that was happening, the thought came to my mind of bringing together any fellow Ohio State students interested in Wikipedia. This is an idea that I would have barely entertained had I gone to a small school. However, at a college campus of nearly 60,000 students and over 6,000 academic staff, I knew that there <em>had</em> to be students that would be interested. Ohio State has over 1,200 student organizations, and I figured - why not make one about Wikipedia?</p>
<p>Coincidentally around this time, I got a blessing: the head of Ohio State's <a href="http://library.osu.edu/about/locations/fine-arts-library/">Fine Arts Library</a>, Sarah Falls, shot me an email. She had seen me listed as a student ambassador for Ohio State, and brought up the idea of hosting an <a href="http://art.plusfeminism.org/">Art+Feminism Wikipedia edit-a-thon</a> here on campus. Due to time constraints, that idea fell through...but it opened the gates for me.</p>
<p>Come spring of 2015, I decided to make my idea a reality and created a student organization called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Connection">Wikipedia Connection</a>. As long as you can show some tangible interest, Ohio State makes it pretty easy to start a new organization. Luckily, my closest friends were supportive of me and my idea, and were happy to write their names down as interested members of the club. Sarah Falls was also happy to sign on and provide support as our organization's official advisor.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/4/350px-Wikipedia_Connection_%28Ohio_State%29_logo.svg.png" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Wikipedia_Connection_%28Ohio_State%29_logo.svg/525px-Wikipedia_Connection_%28Ohio_State%29_logo.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Wikipedia_Connection_%28Ohio_State%29_logo.svg/700px-Wikipedia_Connection_%28Ohio_State%29_logo.svg.png 2x" alt="Wikipedia Connection's logo." width="350" height="120" data-file-width="316" data-file-height="108"  sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/350px-Wikipedia_Connection_%28Ohio_State%29_logo.svg-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/350px-Wikipedia_Connection_%28Ohio_State%29_logo.svg-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/4/responsive/350px-Wikipedia_Connection_%28Ohio_State%29_logo.svg-md.png 768w"> Wikipedia Connection's logo.</p>
<p>This club is a fairly unique idea. Not many student organizations have been started with the sole purpose of learning about and editing Wikipedia, but with the size of Ohio State's campus, this is something I'm confident can work out. In addition to hosting larger edit-a-thons, there are many directions this club can go:</p>
<ul>
	
<li>Hosting weekly or biweekly workshops for students to edit and ask questions.</li>
<li>Hold periodic presentations on various aspects of Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Exploring campus and Columbus to take photos to illustrate Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Work with the university's libraries and archives to research subjects and upload any public domain material.</li>
</ul>
<p>
As the 2015-16 school year has kicked off, the club has been off to a smooth start. Over 60 students signed up for the club's mailing list at the student involvement fair at the beginning of the year. We hosted an introductory meeting, along with our very first edit-a-thon earlier this week. My next blog post will be an overview of that edit-a-thon, along with some of the insights I've taken from that.</p>

                <p>Over this past summer, I had the fortunate opportunity to intern with <a href="https://www.onbase.com/en/">Hyland, creator of OnBase</a>. Specializing in its ECM software, Hyland is located a bit west of Cleveland in the wonderful city of Westlake.</p>
<p>Cleveland isn't exactly known as a popular "tech hub" throughout the United States. It's not Silicon Valley, New York, or Seattle. I'm pretty sure Columbus has been gaining a lot more reputation than Cleveland as being a place for developers to head to. Hyland, however, is special: it's a large tech company in Cleveland that continues to grow and be a great place for its employees. Slides, an arcade, great cafeterias, tennis courts, and campus bikes are a few of the flashy perks I enjoyed. I remember visiting Hyland a few years ago - they only had one building then. Their campus now contains three.</p>
<p>Hyland's got everything: developers, marketers, sales, consultants, and more. I interned within Hyland's Healthcare Services department. These are the guys and gals that work with Hyland's healthcare clients to come up with their OnBase solution. I, however, worked as an internal developer for services, creating tools to help the department out. Being able to develop without the constraints of a formal development department behind my back was nice - I was able to quickly develop tools, and I had the flexibility to do it however I thought was best. It was a refreshing experience, that also provided me with the consideration that there are some awesome job opportunities out there beyond just being a developer (including consulting).</p>
<p>At some point, I did get the welcome surprise of being able to shadow a business trip to Oklahoma City. I wrote a piece about it that got published in the company's OnBase Blog - check it out <a href="http://blog.onbase.com/careers/what-i-learned-on-a-summer-intern-business-trip/">here</a> for a more in-depth view of my experience and thoughts!</p>
<p>That's all I'm going to cover for now; if anyone I know is interested in learning more about interning with Hyland, feel free to reach out to me!</p>

                <p>In the latest versions of Windows, Google Chrome installs itself in the <em>C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome</em> directory. This allows Chrome to be installed for a single user, and doesn't need any administrator permissions to do so. Unfortunately some like to keep all their applications in their <em>Program Files</em> folder - and the normal version of Chrome doesn't allow for users to chose their install location.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to get Chrome to install in different locations (such as using <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/gegy49aC3m0">Junctions</a>), but these solutions can take time and aren't exactly pretty. If you're just looking to install within <em>Program Files</em>, the simplest solution is to install the <a href="https://support.google.com/installer/answer/126299?hl=en">standalone offline version of Chrome</a>. This offline version is designed for users having issues with the standard installer due to network restrictions. It doesn't require an internet connection to install, and – wait for it – also happens to install itself within the <em>Program Files</em> folder. While it is technically an "offline" version, the browser will still connect to Google when it can and automatically install updates, so no need to worry about it going out of date. It is exactly the same as your standard Google Chrome installation.</p>
<p>You'll get two choices when installing: the <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?standalone=1">installer for one user account</a>, or the <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?system=true&amp;standalone=1">installer for all user accounts</a>. The difference is that the former installation will store its user data in a user's own <i>AppData</i> folder, though the program itself will remain installed in <em>Program Files</em>.</p>

                <h3>Here's a solution to getting rid of the annoying "Windows 10 Education" edition watermark yourself.</h3>
<p>I was fortunate enough to get a free copy of Microsoft Windows 10 Education edition through Ohio State and the <a href="https://www.dreamspark.com/">DreamSpark program.</a> The Education edition is comparable to the Enterprise edition, making is a bit more feature-rich than the Home and Pro editions. After hearing so many great things from others who had previewed the new operating system, I was excited to try it out and installed it on the day of release. Everything looked great, except for one thing: I was met with this nasty watermark at the lower-right of my screen, right above the clock:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><a href="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/1/windows-10-education-watermark.png"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/1/windows-10-education-watermark.png" alt="Windows 10 Education watermark" width="211" height="115" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/windows-10-education-watermark-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/windows-10-education-watermark-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/windows-10-education-watermark-md.png 768w"></figure></a></p>
<p>Just like the watermarks in the Windows 10 previews, this watermark serves as a constant reminder that I'm using Windows. Maybe not distracting to some, but I like a minimalistic desktop and I hate having that watermark there. There is currently no easy built-in setting to disable this watermark, and while there are a few programs out there that can remove it, I haven't been sure of their trustworthiness and wanted to see if I could make the change myself. I came up with a solution through the manual method of messing with system files. It's not flawless, as the watermark does pop back up upon restarting your computer (not a big deal if you always put your computer to sleep). However, I explain at the very bottom of this post how you can fix this upon each boot.</p>
<p>This tutorial will involve adjusting file permissions and editing a system hex file that contains the string used to generate the watermark. Be sure to have a hex file editor handy; my favorite is <a href="http://hexedit.com/">HexEdit</a>, which I will be using for this guide.</p>
<p>Note that I have not extensively tested my computer after following these steps, and I am not sure if anything is negatively impacted. Follow this guide and edit system files at your own risk. As with any editing of registry and hex files, you're editing files Windows relies on and I am not responsible if Windows decides to give you a bad day.</p>
<p>That being said, here we go!</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the <em>basebrd.dll.mui </em>file, located in <em>Windows\Branding\Basebrd\en-US</em>. Note that, depending on your language version, the last folder name may be different. If you're having trouble finding it, simply search for it.
<ul>
<li>This dynamic-link library file (.dll) is an example of one of the many .dll files Windows uses to store functions and information used by Windows and other programs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make a copy of this file in a different location, such as your desktop. This will be your backup of the original file in case things go wrong later.</li>
<li>If you aren't familiar with granting yourself access to editing/deleting hex files, follow<a href="http://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-7/windows-7-how-to-delete-files-protected-by-trustedinstaller/"> this guide from Help Desk Geek</a> to give yourself the ability to edit <em>basebrd.dll.mui</em>.</li>
<li>Open <em>basebrd.dll.mui</em> using HexEdit (or other similar program).
<ul>
<li>[Edit: You may likely get a warning telling you that the file is read-only and cannot be modified. If this happens, do the following as an administrator: Right click on the file -&gt; <em>Properties</em> -&gt; <em>Security</em> tab -&gt; <em>Advanced</em> -&gt; <em>Change</em> (in the owner field) -&gt; With the object type set to "User, Group, or Built-in security principal", type in <em>Administrator</em>s as the object name and click <em>OK</em> -&gt; <em>Apply</em> -&gt; <em>OK</em>. Then, go back to the file's properties and within the <em>General</em> tab, you can unselect the <em>Read-only</em> option under the <em>Attributes</em> section.]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Locate line <em>0840</em>. Here, you should find the following hex code and text (alternatively, you can perform a Unicode search for "Education" and you should find the following):</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><a href="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/1/basebrd-hexedit-before.png"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/1/basebrd-hexedit-before.png" alt="basebrd HexEdit before" width="679" height="483" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/basebrd-hexedit-before-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/basebrd-hexedit-before-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/basebrd-hexedit-before-md.png 768w"></figure></a></p>
<ul>
<li>This hex code represents the "Windows 10 Education" text that is used to generate the desktop watermark. Note that there are several related strings surrounding this: "Windows", "Windows 10", "Windows 10 Education", "Windows 10 Education 2", etc. Each of these strings are separated by multiple periods and spaces, but only <em>one</em> is used by the watermark. You can highlight the correct string ("Windows 10 Education") in the box on the right, and HexEdit will highlight the respective hex code on the left. <strong>Remove the hex code for "Windows 10 Education" to remove the watermark!</strong> Be sure to leave the rest of the strings untouched, and to leave three periods between the previous string and the one after it. Here is what my working hex file looked like after the edit, with the previously surrounding text highlighted:</li>
</ul>
<div><a href="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/1/basebrd-hexedit-after.png"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/1/basebrd-hexedit-after.png" alt="basebrd HexEdit after" width="678" height="483" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/basebrd-hexedit-after-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/basebrd-hexedit-after-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.payravi.dev/media/posts/1/responsive/basebrd-hexedit-after-md.png 768w"></figure></a></div>
<ul>
<li>Upon saving the hex file, you should see the watermark disappear the next time you change your desktop background.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this works for you. Feel free to let me know if anything is wrong, goes wrong, or if you find an alternative solution. If something <em>does</em> go wrong, you've got the backup that you may restore. Hopefully, Microsoft removes the watermark in due time as updates start rolling out. Cheers!</p>
<p><strong><i>EDIT:</i></strong> It looks like when you restart your computer, the watermark comes back. However, editing the <em>basebrd.dll.mui</em> hex file through HexEdit will show it unchanged. Opening the file, saving it again, and then changing the desktop background will quickly allow you to remove the watermark upon booting. I'll be looking into a more permanent fix in the meantime.</p>
<p><strong><i>EDIT 2:</i></strong> For anyone wishing to try a third-party program to remove the watermark, I tried out <a href="http://winaero.com/download.php?view.1794">Universal Watermark Disabler</a>. While designed for the Insider Preview versions of Windows 10, it appears to work just fine for removing the Education watermark, and it also claims to not mess around with any system files (including deleting the branding string I discuss above) - which is nice!</p>
